# Digital-Clock-using-HTML-CSS-Javascript
Clocks are a useful element for any UI if used in a proper way. Clocks can be used in sites where time is the main concern like some booking sites or some apps showing arriving times of trains, buses, flights, etc. The clock is basically of two types, Analog and Digital. We will be looking at making a digital one. Building a digital clock using JavaScript can be an excellent project for a beginner to understand the basic concepts of JavaScript. Creating this will help you know about accessing the DOM, adding activity to them, and much more.
